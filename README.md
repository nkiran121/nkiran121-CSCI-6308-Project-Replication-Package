Classification of Bugs using different program Slicing Metrics![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103388788/162644157-034e0ac7-5931-4e2b-9594-19f39042a31c.png)


Abstract:
The main theme is to used to measure the different properties of the program like size, complexity and coupling. Metrics for programme slicing include measures for structure, programme slicing metrics, and programme slicing metrics habits that are programmed. In a series of bug categorization trials, metrics were used. Program Slicing techniques have better results compared to understand for C++ metrics.
I Understand for C++ and programme slicing were utilized metrics calculated for 887 Apache HTTP revisions. The accuracy of their classification prediction was then compared. In terms of performance, programme slicing metrics outperform Understand for C++ metrics. At the file level, (Latex2rtf) accuracy is better than (Latex2rtf). With an aggregate score of 80.4 percent, C++ metrics are easy to comprehend. On a whole program slicing techniques have better bug classification performance compared to understand for C++ metrics.
